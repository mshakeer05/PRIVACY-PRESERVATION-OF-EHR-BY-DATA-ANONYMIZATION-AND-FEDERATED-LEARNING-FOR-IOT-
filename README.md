# PRIVACY-PRESERVATION-OF-EHR-BY-DATA-ANONYMIZATION-AND-FEDERATED-LEARNING-FOR-IOT
Smart cities have upgraded the human lifestyle and it encompasses different 
perspectives of human lives right from basic parking to life saving healthcare agriculture 
applications. As sensitive information is being processed by these applications, several privacy 
and security threats come into picture. In spite of the existence of numerous security 
provisioning solutions, Internet of Things (IoT) devices demand energy efficient and 
lightweight secure mechanisms, owing to their energy restrictions. Hence, this paper presents 
a two phased lightweight privacy preservation approach based on DIVersed and Anonymized 
instances (DIVA), while the second phase involves Federated Learning (FL). FL based on 
Machine Learning (ML) is a boon to IOT, which encourages collaborative learning without the 
need of any raw data across numerous IOT devices and avoids privacy related issues.
